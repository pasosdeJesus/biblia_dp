Let no one deceive

For the mystery of lawlessness already

Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will kill with the

For even
when we were with you, we commanded you this: «If anyone will not work,

For we hear of some who walk among you in
rebellion, who don´t work at all, but are busybodies.

Now those who are
that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness
they work, and eat their own bread.

If any man
