Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We
have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the
Majesty in the heavens,

a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true
tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.

For every high priest is
appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that

things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the
tabernacle, for he said, «See, you shall make everything according to the
pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.»
