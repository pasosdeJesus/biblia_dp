Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem

I went up by revelation, and I
laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately
before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had
run, in vain.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-2-3">
But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was
compelled to be circumcised.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-2-4">
This was because of the false brothers
secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in

But from those who were reputed to be important
(whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn´t show

but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the

circumcision
</sv>

(for he who appointed Peter to the apostleship of the

and when they perceived

that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.

And the rest of the Jews joined him
in his hypocrisy; so that even Barnabas was carried away with their

But when I saw that they didn´t walk uprightly according to
the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, «If you, being a

Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth,
before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth among you as crucified?

</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-2">
I just want to learn this from you. Did you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> receive the Spirit by
the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-3">
Are you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> so foolish?
Having begun in the Spirit, are you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> now completed in the flesh?
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-4">
Did
you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain?
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-5">
He
therefore who supplies the Spirit to you, and works miracles among you, does
he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-6">
Even as
Abraham «believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.»

</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-7">
Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are children of
Abraham.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-8">
The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles
by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, «In you all the
nations will be blessed.»
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-9">
So then, those who are of faith are blessed
with the faithful Abraham.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-10">
For as many as are of the works of the law
are under a curse. For it is written, «Cursed is everyone who doesn´t
continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.»

</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-11">
Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for,
«The righteous will live by faith.»
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-12">
The law is not of faith, but, «The
man who does them will live by them.»

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Galatians-3-13">
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for
us. For it is written, «Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,»
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-14">
that
the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus; that
we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-15">
Brothers, speaking
of human terms, though it is only a man´s covenant, yet when it has been
confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds to it.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-16">
Now the promises were
spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He doesn´t say, «To seeds,» as of many,
but as of one, «To your seed,» which is Christ.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-17">
Now I say this. A
covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four
hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no
effect.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-18">
For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise;
but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.

</sv></cm><cm>

<sv id="Galatians-3-19">
What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the
seed should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through
angels by the hand of a mediator.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-20">
Now a mediator is not between one,
but God is one.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-21">
Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly
not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most assuredly
righteousness would have been of the law.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-22">
But the Scriptures imprisoned
all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be
given to those who believe.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-23">
But before faith came, we were kept in
custody under the law, confined for the faith which should afterwards be
revealed.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-24">
So that the law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ,
that we might be justified by faith.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-25">
But now that faith has come, we
are no longer under a tutor.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-26">
For you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> are all children of God,
through faith in Christ Jesus.

For as many of you as were baptized into
Christ have put on Christ.

There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all
one in Christ Jesus.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-3-29">
If you
<wi type="T" value="P"/> are Christ´s, then you

but is under guardians and
stewards until the day appointed by the father.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-4-3">
So we also, when we were
children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-4-4">
But when
the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born
under the law,
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-4-5">
that he might redeem those who were under the law, that
we might receive the adoption of children.
</sv>
		<sv id="Galatians-4-6">
And because you

These
